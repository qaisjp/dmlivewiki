# dmlivewiki_checksum

This has only been tested on Windows, but it *probably* works on other systems.

# How to use
`dmlivewiki_checksum [options] <path>`

Options:
* `--force, -f     skip the confirmation input`
* `--single, -s    parse the directory given, not the subdirectories`
* `--delete        instead of creating files, delete files`
* `--help, -h      show help`
* `--version, -v   print the version`

# Requires
This only requires `metaflac` to be on the system. You can obtain this from [xiph.org](https://xiph.org/flac/download.html), but the binary (distributed under the GPL) is distributed in the release zip.
